# LAI Rationale & Benefits — Narrative Grounding (for T2)

This document captures *why* LAIs matter and how to differentiate between LAIs, so narrative answers can be precise.

## A) LAI vs Oral / Standard Systemic Regimens
**Core ideas (examples & hooks):**
- **Adherence & Convenience**: fewer doses (q4w/q8w/q12w/6M) → better persistence.  
  *topics:* adherence, convenience, value_vs_oral
- **Route constraints**: no oral bioavailability; food/acid effects; malabsorption post-surgery.  
  *topics:* route_constraints, value_vs_oral
- **PK & Toxicity**: smoother exposure (↓Cmax, better Cmax/Cmin), less systemic toxicity.  
  *topics:* pk_toxicity, steady_state, value_vs_oral
- **Local delivery** (intratumoral, intra-articular, intravesical, intravitreal) → efficacy with reduced systemic exposure.  
  *topics:* local_delivery, value_vs_oral
- **Target occupancy & Resistance**: sustained exposure may keep targets saturated and reduce resistance.  
  *topics:* target_occupancy, resistance, value_vs_oral
- **Patient Experience**: less reconstitution; room-temp storage; smaller needle; SC easier than deep IM.  
  *topics:* usability, injection_pain, storage_condition, value_vs_oral
- **Care Setting & Access**: retail self-injection vs hospital-administered.  
  *topics:* care_setting, value_vs_oral
- **Reversibility**: ability to remove depot in emergency.  
  *topics:* reversibility, value_vs_oral

## B) LAI vs Another LAI (Differentiation)
**Competitive levers (examples & hooks):**
- **Ease of Use**: PFS vs vial + multi-step reconstitution.  
  *topics:* usability, initiation, value_vs_lai
- **Storage & Handling**: room temperature vs refrigerated (wait time burden).  
  *topics:* storage_condition, value_vs_lai
- **Injection Comfort**: smaller needle; SC vs deep IM.  
  *topics:* injection_pain, route_admin, value_vs_lai
- **Initiation Simplicity**: avoid mandatory oral titration at start.  
  *topics:* initiation, value_vs_lai
- **Safety Profile**: absence of PDSS risk is an advantage.  
  *topics:* safety_pdss, value_vs_lai
- **Duration Menu**: choice of intervals (q4w/q8w/q12w/6M/12M) for adherence & convenience.  
  *topics:* dosing_interval, value_vs_lai
- **Burst Control**: limited initial burst; stable plasma over time vs declining curve.  
  *topics:* pk_toxicity, steady_state, value_vs_lai
- **Care Setting**: retail self-injection possible vs hospital-only.  
  *topics:* care_setting, value_vs_lai
- **Reversibility of Depot**: clinical safety lever in emergencies.  
  *topics:* reversibility, value_vs_lai
