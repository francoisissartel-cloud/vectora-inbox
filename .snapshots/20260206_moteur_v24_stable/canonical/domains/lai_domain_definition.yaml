# Conceptual definition for Bedrock understanding
definition: |
  Long-Acting Injectables (LAI) are pharmaceutical formulations designed to 
  provide sustained drug release over extended periods (weeks to months) 
  after a single injection, improving patient adherence and therapeutic outcomes.
  
  Key characteristics:
  - Extended release: days to months duration
  - Injectable route: SC, IM, intravitreal, intratumoral
  - Controlled release technologies: microspheres, depots, hydrogels, PEGylation
  - Dosing intervals: weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual
