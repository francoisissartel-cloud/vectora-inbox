## Fichier 3 – `.q-context/blueprint-draft-vectora-inbox.yaml`

👉 Ce fichier, c’est une **“maquette déclarative”** :  
on y décrit **quoi** on veut (projet, buckets, layout du repo), pas comment coder.

Colle ceci dans `blueprint-draft-vectora-inbox.yaml` :

```yaml
# .q-context/blueprint-draft-vectora-inbox.yaml
